## Getting started for UGA students

One of the easiest ways to run the backend is with intellij IDEA. I highly recommend you make a student account and snag the ultimate version; you'll get a bunch of Spring related tooling, along with warnings (sometimes) when you accidentally write blocking code in a nonblocking context. Helpful!

To actually run the backend, just clone and open this repo with intellij, and click the popup in the bottom right.

The Spring app is almost ready to run! Now we just need a postgres db running, or the application will crash at runtime.

Make sure [psql](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/connecting/psql/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) are installed, then call `./backend/scripts/init_db.sh`.

If you've got a postgres container running, smash the button in the top right

And then [make a request](https://www.postman.com/) to any of the available routes in Routers.java. See below for two examples

## GraalVM Native Support

This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.
It is also possible to run your tests in a native image.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks
If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm backend:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

NOTE: GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ target/backend
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw test -PnativeTest
```
